  post:
    description: "Create or update a collection of instances in a single synchronous request; if any instance fails the complete batch will be rejected (all or nothing). Environment variable DB_ALLOW_SUPPRESS_OPTIMISTIC_LOCKING is required, see https://github.com/folio-org/raml-module-builder#environment-variables for details. The _version property is ignored, optimistic locking is disabled - this is known to lead to data loss in some cases, don't use in production, you have been warned!"
